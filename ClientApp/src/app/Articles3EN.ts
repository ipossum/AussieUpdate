    paragraph: 'We were advised to make the most out of the remaining warm days and spend as much time as possible on the beach. Indeed, it can now get cooler in the morning particularly so if there is a southerly wind originating in Antarctica. Houses here are very badly insulated and the heat pump attached to the wall is the only means to heat up the home.'

The wildlife park of Parndana is a safe haven for injured and abandoned animals. On Kangaroo Island, however, you do not need to visit a wildlife park to encounter animals.',

    paragraph: 'If you are looking forward to a great shopping experience or some luxury holidays, you picked the wrong island. Most of the camping areas are basic with very basic toilet facilities. There is, however, plenty of nightlife. At dusk animals lose their natural shyness. The picture shows a wallaby and a possum. You should not feed wildlife because this leads to problems (e.g. dingo attacks on Fraser Island). The behaviour of the animal suggests that not everybody is aware of this.',

Nobody is happy that we are the first band to play because experts are usually reluctant to give too high marks right at the start. Apart from the test piece, there is a self choice, a hymn and a march on stage to be performed. The street march, which has never been mentioned so far, does not seem to be highly valued in this band.',
