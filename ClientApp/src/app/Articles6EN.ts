    summary: 'Flight to Alice Springs',
    paragraph: 'The original plan was to visit Lake Eyre to witness the rare occurrence of the lake filling with water and the awakening wildlife. The three-hour flight to Lake Eyre, however, would have been as expensive as flying to Alice Springs, which is the gate to West MacDonnell Ranges, Kings Canyon and Uluru.'

    summary: 'Travelling in a Hitop Camper',
    paragraph: 'We picked up a Hitop Camper from the Britz depot in Alice Springs. The vehicle came with a mobile heater which made life at night a lot easier. Of course, we could have stayed in a tent. With temperatures dropping to freezing point during the night this didn’t seem a particular good option.'

    summary: 'Ormiston Gorge at the West MacDonnell Ranges',
    paragraph: 'We spent the first two nights at the West MacDonnell Ranges. Located to the west of Alice Springs these ranges are at least 1000 million years old. The gorges are amazing. Enthusiastic bushwalker are given the opportunity to walk the Larapinta Trail (223 kilometers) that follows the ranges. The group of hikers who we met at the camp at Glen Helen, however, seemed to have lost all enthusiasm. They appeared to be absolutely exhausted.'

    summary: 'Bushwalking at Kings Canyon',
    paragraph: 'The drive to Kings Canyon was not without incident. Our navigation app indicated three hours from Alice Springs, where we had to refuel and buy food, to Kings Canyon. The app didn’t mention the 200 kilometers of dirt road not do be managed by our camper. Driving an alternative route meant an additional two hours, which was too long to make it to Kings Canyon before dark. Driving at night in Australia is a very bad idea due to all the wildlife. We therefore spent the night somewhere in the bush before continuing our journey the next morning.'

    paragraph: 'Getting to see Uluru is impressive. We did the base walk, which took us about four hours. Being places of cultural significance to the native owners some spots along the walk are not allowed to be photographed. Moreover, the Aboriginal people hate to see tourist climb Uluru.'

    summary: 'Sunset at Uluru',
    paragraph: 'Sunrise and sunset at Uluru are a real spectacle. Some marketing guy came up with the clever idea of defining and advertising designated sunrise and sunset points for visitors to flock to. What you can witness at the sunset point in the evening is more about partying than quietly enjoying a natural phenomenon.'

    paragraph: 'It all started with a wrong decision: Should we pick up some prawns on the way home or directly head back to Torquay? We decided to go for the prawns. One minute later, our Falcon was rammed by another car coming from the left. The heavy impact made the Falcon swirl around and sent a tire flying through the air. Our vehicle then collided with the wooden fence of a house situated at the opposite side of the intersection.'

Seeing the Falcon being towed away, however, was sort of a sad thing to witness, as the car had become an important part of our daily life in Australia. Later, when visiting the car yard of Geelong Towing Services and facing all the damaged vehicles stored there I realized how lucky we had been.'

From time to time, however, sightings are reported by the local media. What’s more, some of the kills in the area cannot be explained looking at local predators.'

    summary: 'Cartoon in Another Local Newspaper',
    paragraph: 'Some consider the whole panther story to be a joke as the comic found in another local newspaper illustrates in a funny way. A possible explanation for panthers in Australia could be that US soldiers took panthers as mascots along when coming to Australia during WW2. Some of these animals were later released when the soldiers returned home. Wouldn’t this be similar to the way camels, buffaloes, rabbits and cane toads were introduced to Australia?'
