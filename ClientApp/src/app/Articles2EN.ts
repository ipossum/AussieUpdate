We use bedroom number one as our main bedroom, number two and three as music rooms (yes, we actually practice at home) and number four as a guest room.

        summary: 'Regula riding the trail',
    paragraph: 'Quite recently, the state governments have started to convert these lines into cycle trails, the GREAT VICTORIAN RAIL TRAIL being the longest and most famous one. It took us two weekends to ride most of it starting from Tallarook via Yea to Mansfield. Some of the towns we rode through still have this Wild West Bonanza feel. It was something close to 35 degrees when we finally made it to Mansfield. Why the local sports shop was having skies on display, is a mystery to us.'

Still being just the two of us in one class, Regula and I are enjoying VIP treatment.'

Carnivores might like to hear that steaks up to 700g are readily available from the supermarket. Bad news for cheese lovers: Not affordable.',

Cheers, Alex & Regula'
