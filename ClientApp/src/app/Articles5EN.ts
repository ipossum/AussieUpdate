  summary: 'Sovereign Hill Ballarat (1851)',
    paragraph: 'The gold rush of the 1850s changed Victoria and Australia considerably. Places such as Ballarat grew massively within a very short period of time. Considering that legal and social infrastructure could not keep up with the number of new arrivals, living in these places might have felt like in a Wild West movie. Life was often difficult as can be seen in the below picture.'

  summary: 'Main Street at Sovereign Hill',
  paragraph: 'On one of the original gold fields at Sovereign Hill, a gold mining town was rebuilt. In contrast to other open-air museums, actors on site make the past come alive at Sovereign Hill. While strolling through the town, visitors are passed by an original mail coach, see the army march in, witness the arrest of a burgler, become part of a political rally and enjoy the sights and sounds of muzzle-loaders being fired; all in the style of 1851.'

  summary: 'Political Rally in 1851',
  paragraph: 'During a heated debate from the brothel’s balcony visitors learn what was in people’s mind at the time. The politician makes big promises and is being attacked by local bystanders. Indeed, an overstrained legal system and lots of available money resulted in numerous conflicts.'

  summary: 'The Digger',
  paragraph: 'The new arrivals were mostly diggers, who flooded Australian gold fields from all over the world. Despite the incredible amount of gold being discovered, only about one out of ten diggers really made it big. The likelyhood to get rich being a grocer or an undertaker on site was a lot higher.'

  summary: 'Officer Wearing Uniform of the Time',
  paragraph: 'Maintaining law and order on the gold fields was not an easy task. It did not help that American diggers arrived in Australia with modern revolvers while the local police had to do with muzzle-loaders. Witnessing  the loading and firing of one of those muzzle-loaders, however, was quite an experience.'

  title: 'Lake Eyre is Flooding',
  summary: 'Lake Eyre As a Dry Salt Pan',
  paragraph: 'You might remember the flood in Townsville in February. Strangely enough, the water run off towards the interior of the continent and reached Lake Eyre quite recently. Having a look at the map reveals how incredibly far a distance the water had travelled. Lake Eyre, the largest salt lake on the planet, is flooded every ten years or so.'

  summary: 'The Miracle of Life',
  paragraph: 'And suddenly, life is back; birds as far as the eye can see. Australian scientists have yet to find an explanation how for example pelicans, many of which come from places that are hundreds if not thousands of kilometers away, sense the richness of fish in the newly flooded lake. How fish manage to get through many years of drought at Lake Eyre in the first place, is the even bigger mystery to me.'

  summary: 'Our Solo Cornet Register',
  paragraph: 'The change could not have been more drastic: After months of intensive, sometimes tedious work on a few musical pieces for the national contest in Brisbane, a fun program is now on. We have got five weeks to work through a multitude of entertainment pieces to select and prepare our cabaret concert. Some musicians bring their own arrangements along. Which pieces make it into the program is decided in a very relaxed manner.'

  summary: 'Rainbow Lorikeets Visiting',
  paragraph: 'While some places in Northern Australia still get up to 35 degrees Celsius, temperatures down here can drop to 8 degrees in the morning (outside AND inside our house). Thanks to a compassionate teacher we now have a mobile heater that should help to get through winter. The bottle brush in front of our house is in blossom and attracts colorful visitors.'

  summary: 'Camels at the Red Centre',
  paragraph: 'A visit to the Red Centre is planned for the beginning of June. Learning that a sightseeing flight over Lake Eyre has about the same price tag as flying to Alice Springs and back, we decided to see the real outback. If with or without additional camels, has yet to be decided.'
